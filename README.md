## Description

`ping2` is a Python-based command-line utility that allows users to perform ping tests on one or multiple IP addresses. It sends ICMP echo requests to the specified IP addresses and displays detailed information about packet loss, round-trip times (RTT), and time-to-live (TTL). The ping results are presented in a well-organized table format, making it easy to analyze the network health of various destinations at a glance.

## Features

- Display packet loss, RTT times, and TTL information for each address.
- Output ping results in a tabular format for easy analysis.
